Input:

    Prompt the user to enter an odd integer n (size of the magic square).
    If the user enters an even number, display an error message and terminate the program.

Algorithm:

    Use the Siamese method to generate the magic square. This method works as follows:
        Start with the middle of the last row.
        Place the number 1 in this position.
        The next number goes in the cell to the right and up. If this position is already occupied or goes out of bounds, adjust the position as follows:
            If the position goes out of the right boundary, wrap around to the first column.
            If the position goes out of the top boundary, wrap around to the last row.
            If the target cell is already occupied, move down one cell instead.
        Repeat this process until all numbers from 1 to n*n are placed in the square.

Output:

    Display the generated magic square.
    Display the sum of each row, column, and diagonal.

For example:

For n = 3, the magic square should be:

2 7 6
9 5 1
4 3 8
